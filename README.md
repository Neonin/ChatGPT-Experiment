ChatGPT-Experiment
==================
This application is a front-end project that implements internationalization (i18n) using React,
the popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces,
and i18next, a robust framework for translating web content.
Our application provides a simple, user-friendly interface for converting and displaying various units of measurement,
such as inches to centimeters, pounds to kilograms, and liters to ounces.
It also allows users to format numbers in a local-specific way.

One of the main features of this application is the ability to switch between different locales.
The application currently supports English, French, and Ukrainian.
It demonstrates how to use the react-i18next library
to translate text and format numbers in a way that's appropriate for the selected locale.

### Running the application locally
Install the necessary packages using `npm install`.
Once the installation is complete, you can start the application using `npm start`.
The application will start, and you can access it at http://localhost:3000.

### Changing Locale
- You can switch the application's language by clicking on the language selector provided in the interface.
- The language selector is located in the top right corner of the application.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
